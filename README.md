# Learning-Journey---Python- 
This is to document my journey to self-teach the skills necessary to become a software developer :)  I will aim to post my daily code, partly to keep me accountable and as part of my #100daysofcode, but also to look back at what I have achieved as sometimes, one can easily overlook how far one has grown :)
## Conditional executions & loops
Today I practised some basic control flow using functions.
Click [here](conditionalexecutions&loops\if,elif,else.md) for more details.

## GitHub
Today I tried to understand how Github works, hence this :) 
click [here](Github\Github.md) for more!

## Functions
This is day 3 of posting, but have been consistent in my coding. This week, I have been working some more with for and if loops, also been looking at range(), manipulating dictionaries, sets, lists, and tuples inside functions. Need to practise some more. Click [here](Functions\functions.py) for some examples of problems I have been looking at.
