# Learning-Journey---Python- 
This is to document my journey to self-teach the skills necessary to become a software developer :)  I will aim to post my daily code, partly to keep me accountable and as part of my #100daysofcode, but also to look back at what I have achieved as sometimes, one can easily overlook how far one has grown :)
## Day 1
Today I practised some basic control flow using functions.

## Day 2
Today I tried to understand how Github works, hence this :)

## Day 3
This is day 3 of posting, but have been consistent in my coding. This week, I have been working some more with for and if loops, also been looking at range(), manipulating dictionaries, sets, lists, and tuples. Need to practise some more. Click [here](Day3/Day3.md) for some examples of problems I have been looking at.
