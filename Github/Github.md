## GitHub

A Github kinda day! I leaned how to do what you see here by:
- Downloading Github onto my laptop 
- Accessing it through VSCode (hence why I'm still confused about the necessity of step one)
- Creating different directories, folders and files on VSCode
- Linking my folders and files to the README.md file
- 'Pushing' my work to be published on the browser and my repository
- I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzdRE7Uw4-M) super helpful, it is the reason I have been able to do all the steps above. 

I still have a long way to go to learn more about github, but for now, it's onto learning more Python - Codecademy, here I come!
